# COMP3005_Final_Project
This is my Final Project on COMP 3005 - Database Management Systems at Carleton University
===================================================================================================
1. Queries in queries_database as well as queries.py are to be tested using dbexports.sql. I have used data from dbexports.sql to form my queries. 
===================================================================================================
2. In project_database, we can see the loaded data by having statements at the end like : SELECT * FROM matches; or SELECT * FROM lineups; or SELECT * FROM competitions; ===================================================================================================
